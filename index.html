        For the hobby page I had a lot to learn as I had never made a website before. It was daunting to learn how everything so and I didn't know where to start. I started by trying to learn from the 
        rescorces in the FAC project page. I worked on FreeCodeCamp and from this I learnt a lot of the basics. I built as much as I could and then would have to look things up as I wanted and needed to do them.

        For the gallery I had to start learning more about CSS and how to use flexbox to make a webpage. This involved a lot of 
        tutoirials and looking things up. There were many different chalenges I needed to master also. I needed to display the 
        websites in a gallery format. There were other features that were needed, I needed a button that would expand the descrition 
        and for the gallery to rote into a column view for smaller screens.
